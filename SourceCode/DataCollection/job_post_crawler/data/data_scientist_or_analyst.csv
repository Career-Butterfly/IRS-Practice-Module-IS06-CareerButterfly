Fabrica AI is creating a future where ideating and developing a robot for any task takes days, not years. We believe that by training end to end controls in simulation with reinforcement learning and above that iterating hardware designs, we can automate the whole development process. At the current stage, the most important resource is a large fleet of robots to validate our approaches for our AI system and to collect data. This would help keep us grounded in reality.
To start building up the fleet, we invented an automatic tile grouting robot that boosts productivity by 5x and are piloting it on construction sites in Singapore managed by Woh Hup, BHCC, Gin Chia, Soilbuild, and Dragages. This should correspond to about 30% of the Singaporean market. We have early leads in the US and Europe as well. Tile grouting is the process of filling up the gaps between tiles after the tiles have been laid. Grouting is part of virtually every construction project and a highly laborious process, is considered one of the most physically damaging tasks resulting in tilers’ knees and back issues, and thus quality issues would also arise. We invented a patent pending robot that is able to automatically grout and clean tile gaps with only a press of a button. The operators would only need to reload grout and water.
We have also pitched at the Built Environment Demo Day 2022 organised by BCA as part of the International Built Environment Week (IBEW) and won the Rising Star Award. IBEW has drawn more than 10,000 individuals from over 100 countries.
Recently, we had a Presentation to Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7034394354731413504
We have also raised 850k USD from Hoxton Ventures to enable our development in not just our tile grouting robots but also other forms of construction automation.

At Grab, every Grabber is guided by The Grab Way, which spells out our mission, how we believe we can achieve it, and our operating principles - the 4Hs: Heart, Hunger, Honour and Humility. These principles guide and help us make decisions as we work to create economic empowerment for the people of Southeast Asia.

Get to know our Team:
Grab’s Fulfilment-Dispatch Data Science team works on challenging and fascinating problems surrounding Grab’s allocation capabilities — ensuring our passengers, driver-partners, consumers and merchants enjoy a reliable fulfilment experience.
Allocation is simply this question: “Given a new booking request, which driver-partner is the best match for this booking, accounting for all other pending bookings now, and all potential bookings and driver-partner movements in the future?” Efficiently solving this problem requires working on domains and techniques such as statistical/machine/deep-learning-based prediction, optimization, simulation, graph theory, offline and online learning of contextual parameters, and geospatial data mining. We apply these techniques on our high-volume high-velocity datasets to drive optimal business outcomes.
We foster a culture where we enjoy raising the bar constantly for ourselves and others, and that strongly supports the freedom to explore and innovate. We are looking for candidates who are excited to work on challenging problems, who can apply their breadth and depth of knowledge to design innovative solutions, and who push boundaries in improving the growing suite of allocation-related services for our users.

Experience in developing production-grade ML systems including exploratory analysis, feature engineering, developing data pipelines, observability and maintenance etc.
Strong aptitude in statistics and large-scale data analytics:
Understanding of probability and statistics (e.g. hypothesis testing, modeling distributions / regressions, Bayesian statistics etc)
Experienced in running live experiments (A/B tests, randomized controlled trials) and analyzing their results
Experienced with relational databases, SQL, and distributed computing frameworks (Spark, Kafka stream processing)
Strong software development skills:
Proficient in Python. Skill in Golang, Scala or Rust is an advantage.
Familiar with Git-based source control, code reviews, test-driven development, cloud-based development (AWS/Azure)
Self-motivated, independent learner, and willing to share knowledge with the team

Get to know our Team:
Grab’s Fulfilment-Dispatch Data Science team works on challenging and fascinating problems surrounding Grab’s allocation capabilities — ensuring our passengers, driver-partners, consumers and merchants enjoy a reliable fulfilment experience.

Allocation is simply this question: “Given a new booking request, which driver-partner is the best match for this booking, accounting for all other pending bookings now, and all potential bookings and driver-partner movements in the future?” Efficiently solving this problem requires working on domains and techniques such as statistical/machine/deep-learning-based prediction, optimization, simulation, graph theory, offline and online learning of contextual parameters, and geospatial data mining. We apply these techniques on our high-volume high-velocity datasets to drive optimal business outcomes.

We foster a culture where we enjoy raising the bar constantly for ourselves and others, and that strongly supports the freedom to explore and innovate. We are looking for candidates who are excited to work on challenging problems, who can apply their breadth and depth of knowledge to design innovative solutions, and who push boundaries in improving the growing suite of allocation-related services for our users.

Experience in developing production-grade ML systems including exploratory analysis, feature engineering, developing data pipelines, observability and maintenance etc.
Strong aptitude in statistics and large-scale data analytics:
Understanding of probability and statistics (e.g. hypothesis testing, modeling distributions / regressions, Bayesian statistics etc)
Experienced in running live experiments (A/B tests, randomized controlled trials) and analyzing their results
Experienced with relational databases, SQL, and distributed computing frameworks (Spark, Kafka stream processing)
Strong software development skills:
Proficient in Python. Skill in Golang, Scala or Rust is an advantage.
Familiar with Git-based source control, code reviews, test-driven development, cloud-based development (AWS/Azure)
Self-motivated, independent learner, and willing to share knowledge with the team
Detail-oriented and efficient time manager in a dynamic working environment
Able to communicate well in English both verbally and in written communication, as well as convey data insights and results with effective visualizations.
Nice to have:
Experience in working with geospatial/mobility/logistics data
Experience in designing probabilistic models at scale in production
