A natural problem solver.

You'll love working with us if you're the type that:
Is curious, humble, and earnest.
Is a strong team player, and comfortable in an ambiguous environment.
Holds strong opinions but is open to being proved wrong.
Speaks their mind, but respectfully.
Is always looking to be better.

The joint CAAS-Thales innovation lab known as ‘AIR Lab’ started to operate on 1st November 2019 with the objective to develop Proof of Concepts (POCs) or Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) of advanced and open technologies for future Air Traffic Management (ATM). Currently, the joint lab employs a team of 40 Thales engineers and 12 CAAS engineers and air traffic controllers operating in a vibrant ecosystem involving a number of Singaporean SMEs and start-ups, as well as key research institutes.
Thales engineers include 10 domain experts – with more than 10 years of experience – coming from Thales ATM centres of competence in France and Australia. These experts are coaching both the local Thales and CAAS engineers.
The POCs and MVPs are co-developed with the CAAS engineers who have access to the same development tools and environment used by the Thales Engineers (provided by the Singapore branch of Thales Digital Factory). The POCs and MVPs are defined in collaboration with CAAS air traffic controllers through iterative workshops.
AIR Lab research outcomes will feed the next generation of products, including clearly disruptive outcomes addressing Safety and Security for Open architecture, data driven ATM Twin, Green Aviation, Trajectory Based Operations.
As the AIR Lab was recently extended for another 3 years, 4 work streams are now embarked:
Regional Experimental Platform, FF-ICE/TBO, Green Aviation, Future-proof Interoperable Platform-Agnostic, Safe and Secure Platforms.
AIR Lab 2.0 continues to benefit from research conducted in Europe through new architecture research which, among other objectives, aims at meeting much stricter safety standards for ground ATM systems in development by the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA).

Imperial College London and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) are seeking Senior Research Fellows, Research Fellows, and Research Engineers to join the exciting new Imperial/NTU CYber Protection for HEalthcaRe (IN-CYPHER) research programme on the cybersecurity of connected medical devices and systems. The research programme represents a collaboration between the United Kingdom and Singapore and will be based at the newly established Imperial Global Singapore (IGS) as National Research Foundations Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) located on the campus of the National University of Singapore.
IN-CYPHER is comprised of four interacting themes, spanning the design of intelligent medical devices through to the use of their data in informing personalised healthcare. Allied to other programmes in Singapore and the UK, it represents a unique opportunity to be at the forefront of research and development into securing the vital information that flows from implantable, wearable and connected medical devices, and the personalised healthcare systems that consume such data. The four themes of IN-CYPHER are:
· Theme 1 Protecting Implantable Devices
· Theme 2 Securing Connected Wearables & Healthcare Systems
· Theme 3 Algorithms for Privacy, Security and Provenance
· Theme 4 Clinical Innovation & Translation
Connected medical devices are increasingly employed in the drive towards increasingly personalised health, and in delivering virtually all aspects of healthcare. With key researchers and teams from both Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, we seek to develop deep technologies that are informed by threat models for the emerging area of personalised medicine, and specifically where patient stratification or treatment personalisation leverages processes that use data-driven machine learning.
Given the span of the IN-CYPHER programme, we are seeking up to 8 highly motivated scientists, or senior scientists and research engineers, with backgrounds in engineering, computer science and healthcare informatics to represent the founding team of the IN-CYPHER programme. Unique in its scope, our research remit spans embedded systems, and the protocols used to control and communicate sensitive patient information, all the way up to interventional devices, data science and applied. machine learning for personalised healthcare. We are seeking all levels of researcher, encompassing a wide range of disciplines and scientific or engineering backgrounds, including, but not limited to::
- Cybersecurity engineering
- Large Language Models (particularly fine-tuning LLMs, and Mixtures of Experts)
- ASIC design and hardware engineering
- Biomedical sensor design and fabrication
- Data science
- Biomedical Engineering
- Software engineering
- Cybersecurity threat modelling
- Data-driven personalised healthcare
- Model-based personalised healthcare (e.g. pharmokinetic modelling)
- Translational and regulatory expertise in medical devices
We are seeking candidates with drive and passion to be self-motivated innovators, at TRL levels from 0 through to 3. Candidates with strong publication profiles are particularly welcome, but a willingness to assimilate the complexities of working with innovators of healthcare technology and patient data, and to work as part of a diverse team, are critical. A willingness to contribute and lead on the production of high-quality research outputs is also essential.
The collaborating Departments include senior academics from the Department of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction and the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial – the largest Biomedical Engineering Department in the UK – and senior researchers from the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE), School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine at Nanyang Technological University. Candidates will be employed by Imperial Global Singapore, a research division of Imperial College London, consistently ranked within the top 10 of the QS University Rankings. Candidates must be resident and based in Singapore, but there will be opportunities for research visits to Imperial’s London-based locations.
