Stable job.,"I did not think Micron will have cons, but comparing to Infineon and Globalfoundaries which are also in downturn and doing badly, Micron has developed many cons in last 2 years 1. Salary is VERY low compared to market. 2. Micron prefers fresh hires and don't adjust salary compared to youngsters or Fresh Hires. This pay revision cycle I got 3% raise compared to my junior who got 9% raise. Both of us no promotion and but of us high rating of 4. So you can see clear differentiation. 3. No OT allowed to enter, even if you work extra hours. No time-off and no compensation of any kind. 4. No Micron points (Bravo) anymore. So if you collaborate with other teams, the maximum you will get is a stupid email of appreciation. No spot bonus also. 5. Biggest issue of all: no FAIR promotion. The people who get promoted are those have HIGH visibility and those who impress bosses. Cliche roles like automation which do not see immediate gains, will be ignored.",0.8519,0.3196,-0.5,0.042874999999999996,,,0.3196,,,,,,,,dev_ops_engineer

It's not fair across the company. There are some teams whose leader or managers are good, they don't need to work hard but still get high grade. However, other teams are not under good manager, even they work hard, they still get bad grade. Bad grade means not increase in salary and going to higher rank. - Deadlines are a lot.
