Based on which project you are in and your relationship with your project manager. Some people who perform so so, come late and go home on time can get same or better performance rating than those who need to handle a lot workload, work overtime, and traveling to-and-from client site. - Was in a maintenance project, need to stand by support during the weekends and no there was off-in-lieu, even if issues happen and you have to work during the weekends. The managers think it's your duty. - The managers have no clue what and how the team is actually doing. They are totally layman. Even if got issues they cannot help and solve. All they know is project margin, budget, timeline, what is the issue severity, can issue severity be downgraded so that no need to escalate, what to report to the higher management, meeting and micromanagement. - Some managers want to save project budget, instead of hiring new people, they ask you to work in two projects. They say 20% 80%, but actually you have to work 100% 100%. I mean, seriously, how do you measure works in 20%80%? - Company and projects want to save cost. A lot of time needs to work with offshore team in India. Hard to communicate and collaborate with them especially in government projects, a lot of constraints sharing project knowledge with them."

This pay revision cycle I got 3% raise compared to my junior who got 9% raise. Both of us no promotion and but of us high rating of 4. So you can see clear differentiation. 3. No OT allowed to enter, even if you work extra hours. No time-off and no compensation of any kind. 4. No Micron points (Bravo) anymore. So if you collaborate with other teams, the maximum you will get is a stupid email of appreciation. No spot bonus also. 5. Biggest issue of all: no FAIR promotion.

0,Micron Technology,,1.0,Reasons You Should Never Work in Micron,Manufacturing Engineer,Singapore,"Pros. Well its hard to say. I wish I could tell you there are some good things in working here but there really isn't. Well, they pay you decent and comes with a good health claim (unless they took those away too), but thats really the bare minimum for any company. Most added benefits unique to the company were taken away. Location wise, for Backend there were quite a few cheap and decent food options nearby but its a business area so I'm sure you'll have access to those in a different company anyway.","Cons. Well, oh I sure have stories for you. Micron's Core Values consist of People, Innovation, Tenacity, Collaboration and Customer Focus. People, what does that mean to you? You would think it means they take care of their people right? Wrong. Micron is entirely about numbers. They try their best to show in numbers to the world/media that people of all race, ethnicity, gender are welcomed for their talents. But it ends there. The moment you enter the doors of the company, you're treated like trash. Innovation? Innovation is constantly forced from each employee each shift of each day, You would think this means that the company is part of Industry 4.0 right? Wrong. It's barely part of the third Industrial revolution. Everything is backwards. Data is keyed in manually and despite the mass amounts of informations. Most machines aren't autonomous and require manpower, robotics aren't used and the current software they're using which is extremely backdated and inconvenient to use, was made in the early 2000's/late 1990's. You know what's the most ridiculous part? You're expected to collate all those for each meeting during each shift, yeah sometimes there's a tableu someone created or you're asked to create it but most of the time it is not working. Tenacity haha. Well they do expect tenacity alright, the most extreme version of it from you. They expect you to sacrifice you time, your pay, your mental health for this tenacity of theirs. You're expected to work 24/7, there's no such thing as a break, you're not paid OT, there's no compensation to take time off instead either. Even if its 3am, you're expected to reply. Why? because its a 24/7 plant. Collaboration. Yup its when your superiors steal your work and credits, how fun. And lastly, Customer Focus. Oh believe this alright, Micron is extremely customer focused at the risk of their employees. They would sacrifice you to please their customers. Doesn't matter if you worked 5 weekends straight of 15 hours each day without additional pay or compensation, customer always comes first. Now that we're done with that, let me go into more details. I was laid off and was from Micron Singapore's Backend in the Manufacturing Department of the Assembly side. I signed a contract stating my roles, position, pay, OT pay, allowance, etc. I was to work in two week cycles of 3 days in the first week and 4 days in the second week while alternating day shift and night each cycle. I was to be a Manufacturing Shift Engineer with specified roles. However, despite this being what I had signed a contract for, it was absolutely false. They initially told me its just the first 2 weeks I would work the normal 5-day day shift to get used to things as I would have trainings and would be following around fellow engineers/senior engineers/managers to understand the plant's processes. 2 weeks had passed and no changes, my job scope completely changed, I was changed to a different position under ""manufacturing engineer"" which is just an excuse for them to throw you wherever they want. My initial supervisor who was a manager was also changed to someone else. And the worst part? They had changed me to working 5 days a week of regular day shift without my knowledge whilst falsely promising me I would be changing to my original shift soon which also meant that I would be getting no allowance since I was not in shift work. Another major red flag? The day I walked into the company, EVERYONE knew my pay. The people who interviewed me spread around to everyone in the manufacturing department whom I would be working with at that point, my pay. I had questioned the supervisors on my first day, only for them to brush it off and say its because the pay was slightly higher than it was previously without thinking about the implications of such a thing and how that would negatively affect a new employee. I received so much negativity, jealousy and refusal to guide me (despite being assigned to me) because of this. I was completely new to manufacturing in a semicon industry and was assigned to 9 different engineers who were supposed to show me their processes they handle but only 1 engineer actually did it, yet it was reported as they did what was assigned to them. I sourced for people myself, trainers, technicians, workers of each process to be able to learn. There was no sort of proper passdown or aid at all. They had 0 preparedness in terms of hiring a new employee. They had placed me in IPPC, which is basically planning and control of the inline production. The lead engineer tuned manager of Assembly IPPC was only interested in forcing the department to think that they can't do anything without him. To continue doing so, he constantly gave the impression to higher ups that my fellow engineer and I, and my technicians were doing a bad job, spreading false rumours, taking our credits, especially for me since I was new, he would constantly belittle me saying I've got no improvements, I'm doing a bad job, I shouldn't have been hired only for him to take my credit. He was dictatorial. He even gave higher ups excuses just to get a secluded room outside the open plan office where everybody worked just to show authority and close the door, yell and scream at us as his punching bag for when if we did something better than him or didn't do it exactly the way he would do it. Despite having numerous HR cases against him by his former team members, he was still promoted to manager for work he did years ago and never worked much again since. He was extremely manipulative, disrespectful, arrogant, spiteful and a liar. He would guilt me into working 24/7, into working weekends and working for free. 1 month plus into working in Micron, they said they aren't gonna pay OT anymore and that they ""encouraged"" everyone to leave on time. But no we couldn't leave, we had to do the alot of work and its not like we can leave without completing it since everything is shiftly. I did not have many public holidays to myself and so many weekends, I had to work. I was not compensated in any way and all the numerous benefits I was supposed to have was taken away because they claim they don't have the money. However as I worked in planning and control and at some point we were not pre producing anything anymore, I could see that we were still producing the same amount of orders each week but without any of the benefits going to the employees. Essentially people were working more for free. Now why should I work all those extra hours for free? Your supervisors force you to, they manipulate and guilt trip you into doing that. I was constantly threatened, to be placed into probation which would negatively affect my performance review which essentially affects IPP. The manufacturing department loved forging numbers. Given instructions by the test senior manager of the manufacturing department and director of the manufacturing department in Backend. The Ceo wanted everyone to have work life balance and had an initiative where meeting hours are cut down to only the necessary ones so we could be more focused on getting work and leaving on time. The meeting time and schedules of each employee were tracked and these department heads demanded everyone deleted any online meeting in calendars( we had a practice of inserting all online and in person meetings), just so they could meet the targets but we were still having 4-5 hours meetings each day behind management. Personally, on a bad day, I would have 7 hours of ""essential"" meeting, for comparison a day shift work day is 9 hours including lunch. This gave me no time to tend to my work and moreover I would have to come earlier just to prep slides for each meeting. Initially they had food allowance each day but they took that off saying they couldn't afford it too. Most contract workers from malaysia and china would rely on OT and food vouchers in order to be able to afford rent and food in Singapore but could not do anything when the company stopped it. Lastly, I was laid off by Micron. Out of the batch of employees I was hired with, I'm pretty sure I did most work, one of the most important work, high quality work and long long hours of work. Yet I was all of a sudden told to pack up and leave with so much of my extra hours uncompensated for. What I lacked? Personal connection. One thing to know about Micron is that many family and spouses and relatives, friends worked there together and with each other. Even if they didn't do any work, they were still chosen to stay. With these people who have personal connections in the same pay grade, be prepared to be doing a ton more work than them and have your credits given to them. In summary, Micron is filled with deception, degradation, dictatorship, biasness, bad management, no work life balance, bad work environment, no support and care to employees and no fulfilment of promised benefits. Don't pin your hopes on colleagues either as due to the inadequate higher management, senior test ippc manager, ippc assembly manager and director of the manufacturing department, colleagues constantly berate each other and throw each other under the bus during meetings just to save their own skin instead of working together to solve potential problems and work on improvements for the production line."

It can make or break the start of your career with Accenture. - Also subject to the management on the project. If your project's management doesnt understand tech or doesnt know how to run your project, a technical career can suddenly turn into a political one and you become an email and ppt warrior.

I had no Accenture side manager who had any idea of the kind of technical work that I did for the client. When it was time for my promotion cycle, I had to go on maternity leave , and I got to know later that due to some internal politics they gave preference to some other candidates whose rating was lower than mine under the assumption that I may decide to extend my maternity leave and may not come back after its completion.Also they completely ignored the positive reviews provided by the client and I had to call them up on a weekend to remind them to put the positive feedback in my appraisal as they were unaware of the work I had done as they have never been to my client workplace."

At the end of the financial year, each will be graded through a banding system whereby your reviewer and counsellor will present your performance at a banding meeting. In my opinion, the grading system is pretty much based on the project revenue and how well your reviewer/supervisor fight for you in the banding meeting as you are graded against peers from other projects also. So, it pretty much depends on luck."

0,Accenture,,2.0,Time demanding and unfullfilling work,Associate Software Engineer,Singapore,"Extensive benefits Accenture offers all full-time employee subsidised medical compansation up to 30% of their clinical visits, and subsidised dental consultant. Full-time employees are allowed to visit some tourist attractions for free. High degree of autonomy and job flexible Everyone in the team is given a clear role in the project. They have been held accountable for their own actions, and they are allowed to work on the way they felt right. The company is on more of a 'Result-only work environment', when you can work at your own pace and timing, as long as you met the deadline. The company allow you to enter the company at your own timing as long as it's not overboard. I have worked with developers who only came into work after lunch.","No sense of purpose There is no sense of purpose working in the company. One of the company motto is ' Client Value Creation'. From my understanding Client Value Creation is to advise the client on what is the best for them, and not blindly follow what the clients, and in the end, let the clients suffer with a lousy product. Unattainable goals More often, the project manager sets unrealistic deadline for almost every aspects of the project. At the first start of the project planning, the management has already planned 10 (+/- 1) hours of workload to be completed in a workday, which allowed them to complete the project on-time. With such unattainable goal-setting, employees had to often finding them working overtime daily. Unfair pay compensation More than often, more than half of the employees work overtime more than 40% of their regular working hours for extended period of more than two months annually. There is no overtime pay for all additional hour put in. In additional, the management is not at all appreciative of the employees' overtime effort, instead, the management sees it as a complusory free labour. When comparing the pay structure of the project, almost half of the employees are being paid below the market rate. Closed-minded management Whenever the management encountered problem, they will seek advice from the employees. However, the management will more than often not take the advice, and made their own decision. This make the feedback irrelevant, and slowly, the employee stop giving feedback, as they knew that their feedback will not be taken by the management."

Not that many big ego's - people generally on the level (this can be misconstrued as apathy sometimes)","You need patience. It can be very frustrating to navigate and leverage to get things done. Don't expect spoon feeding, it's a ""figure it out yourself"" environment. Generally, office facilities are quite poor in some locations. Quality of staff is less developed countries causes frustration and leads to focus on rigid process (as people can't be trusted to think for themselves).

In IT you are just a body to be assigned to whichever project your line manager chooses, your own career progression goals are ignored. The IT PMs seemed to think that having daily status meetings (sometimes even twice a day) and calling them scrum meant they were 'doing agile'....

Steve Luczo is great guy, he was the one who brought back the company from rags to the situation it is now. Relatively stable employment. Fair benefits. Fair employee care. The core business of company has lost its competitve edge. All these years it had been surviving with minimal profit margin. But now that SSD price are declining, Seagate is in hot soup. It is franctically buying other companies to keep itself afloat.","Manager is the deciding authority. Some undesirable managers who grew up the corporate ladder buttering superiors has set a system. They expect the subordinates to kiss their feet, their job will be saved, good appraisal etc. Skills, expertises are ignored and pleasing the supervisor counts when deployed under these managers. In general people have become complacent over the years, they are not agile or agressive and hence loosing business to its major competitor and solid storage devices market. Steve Luczo is great guy, he was the one who brought back the company from rags to the situation it is now. But that does not mean company employees are of good standard.

There is no proper screening of employees, some with Bachelor of Arts degree from India also join as Associate Engineer because of recommendation. The guy driving forklift in Malaysia also join as Associate Engineer because of recommendation. Some supervisors are under qualified because they are old timers, just NITEC cert, but managing staff with poly engineering diplomas, so they are forever scared of ambitious hardworking qualified personal. This kind of supervisors appreciate and promote low qualified Malaysian friends to keep a buffer around them since they themselves are Malaysian or former Malaysian. You can see people from Penang / Perak has a strong most in Seagate Woodlands but some of them are really well qualified but some just pull strings to stay on. S-pass holders come in with basic pay of $2,850 because of the minimum pay requirement set by MOM for S-pass. But Singaporeans and PRs who are in the company for almost a decade doing the same tasks as the newcomer S-pass holders are still on the journey to hit $2,850 since they started below $2,000 as fresh graduates.

0,Amazon,,5.0,New Joiner Review,Senior Cloud Architect,Singapore,"The company lives and breathes by the Leadership Principles, they are not for show unlike other companies, and the culture is excellent. The focus on onboarding is the best I've seen in my 10+ years of working. Hierarchy is flat, the colleagues are excellent, there is a high level of psychological safety in terms of speaking up and making honest (non-deliberate) mistakes. All of their working principles are backed by scientific research you have probably read in articles (eg. Harvard Business Review, etc), but almost never followed in your current company ever - except Amazon. Technical wise, you working for the world's best Cloud Provider and have a ton of opportunities to learn.","The culture is not for everyone. You have to be very disciplined, a self-starter, and manage your own time and career. In short, you must have a high degree of ownership. This is not a con if you have the right mindset and making very deliberate choices on what you want to focus on (job, experience, family, etc.) Looking at what others have written negatively, especially about work-life balance, they are more of a bad fit rather than a con of working at Amazon. There are many avenues to seek help when you feel overwhelmed, but you have to own the decision."

The company is a market leader and the quality of most functions is really high. Despite lots of work and the fast pace, there are enough get togethers/parties/celebrations.","You need to work smart to keep up with the fast pace; you need to be able to identify what is important and what is not, and drop the not so important stuff -- and be prepared to justify your decision. Most managers will understand if you made a mistake as long as you thought about it rationally first. Your career is in your hands -- most everyone is too busy to do more than give you high-level advice. If you keep your head down and become excellent at your level, you will remain a highly appreciated employee at your level. To be promoted, you need to try and get involved in things that give higher ups a chance to see your work. Salaries are not the highest, though they are not bad either.

Only good thing is last time they hired employees directly. but now not happening. If you are really desperate on finding jobs only you may join to pactera singapore.,"Low salary.

Favoritisms for some employees. 2 months notice and 3 or few months pay back for pass holders. Have to work late nights, weekends but no lieu leaves or compensations. No quality of works."

0,Pactera,,1.0,"Good workplace but heartless, overuse of my positionand unlogical mindset.",Senior Associate Engineer,"Bukit Merah Estate,",I've been working for more than 3 years. The working environment is good and having good colleagues to work with. Showing my leadership and work along with Interns and testers very well till they are fond of working with me alot of time.,"Unlogical, overuse of my position and heartless. These are the words I'm facing everytime if I take MC or leave. Heartless - I was going to take MC due to sharp pains on my stomach which I was unable to move fast or move around. And when I said about taking MC, they said my work is priority and have to come to work whatever regardless of my condition because my testing project is running. I was shocked of this and have to come to work despite of my condition and ended up coming to work late. Upon reaching to office, none has show concern and ignore me of my condition. Then when I ask for half day to visit the doctor, they said my project have to settle full day and cannot be halfway done. When I complain about this issue, i got a verbal warning for being rude towards my higher position. I ended up stay back till 5.30pm and visit the doctor which I eneded up in a serious condition which involve vomitting and visible blood on my bowels. It's totally heartless. Overuse of my position - I'm a Senior Associate Engineer and I suppose to do some managing testing prototype printers, prepare test plans and work along with testers, record down of daily tasks completed runs and updating clients of the summary. My pay is just $1800 with no bonus or any increments for 3+ years which they MENTIONED earlier when I transferred to this department due to changing to my new role of position from Tester role. But actual tasks I'm doing positions like Logistics, Enviromental Chamber management, IT support, Delivery & Tester. So do I deserve that kind of pay? Even when they seeking for Driver position to do for delivery, after the new driver sign with the company, they ask the Driver to do logisitic WHICH they fail to mention in the first place which the company totally change driver for 4 times within 1 year span. Unlogical mindset - what comes first? Health or work? For me, it's health. There is one day that I was unable to come to work due to my wife is 5 month pregnant with our 2nd child and was unable to move around without assistant or have to settle my son's health. I have to take leave for 2 days straight and when I tell them about taking leave, they simply dont care and tell me off about my discipline and I got no responsible about my work. And they assume of me not coming to work due to high volume of projects running. I was in shocked of their mindset. When I told them off that they are welcome to come to my house to see the situation of my Wife and son, again they said that I cannot speak in that way and got another verbal warning. When other people or them having coughing, flu or seriously sick, their reason are being easily accepted. It's unfair and how heartless they are. I got lots of proofs and screenshots of what I'm going through when my family is sick."

There are some people in the company who think they know better than everyone else about everything. This makes the environment very toxic. 5. Very poor and outdated softwares and processes used probably due to cost. Doesn’t feel like a company geared for Industry 4.0. 6. Asian style management.

We were not given enough time to research extensively and think things through. - Workload could be heavy, to the point that personal time was sacrificed. - There was also an unbalanced allocation of workload. Capable engineers were loaded more heavily. - The engineers were working on all sorts of different projects, as long as they were related to their fields.

The plant is forced to squeeze whatever juice remaining of the old equipments which are less efficient - Paltry employee benefits.

It usually we have to work overtime 1 or 2 hours. There are some teams have to work overnight sometimes. - Military ranking system. All employees are ranked and judged like military soldier - Bad evaluation system to judge employee performance. It highly depends on team leader or manager's perspective. It's not fair across the company. There are some teams whose leader or managers are good, they don't need to work hard but still get high grade. However, other teams are not under good manager, even they work hard, they still get bad grade. Bad grade means not increase in salary and going to higher rank. - Deadlines are a lot. Developers usually do not have time to think about good solution to solve problem. My personal opinion is quality product is not so good in term of designing. Later, it will really cost in maintenance phase."
