Why Cisco
WE ARE CISCO
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We drive digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

What we do?
Milieu Insight is a consumer research and analytics company. We help businesses thrive in a data-driven world of rapid change, where the need for reliable, quick information to make strategic decisions has never been greater. We believe in the transformative power of going beyond insights and we’re driven by our passion to understand people - how they think, feel and act. Through smart automation, best-in-class technology, a core focus on user experience, and most importantly, an amazing team, we collect and deliver consumer insight like no other research company around.
How we do it?
We collect our data through a proprietary mobile app known as Milieu Surveys (just search for it in the Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines & Thailand app stores if you’d like to give it a spin). The opinions shared by our community of panellists are synthesised through our proprietary algorithms, allowing us to gain a deep understanding of what drives their personal and social motivations, as well as their consumption habits.
What motivates us (and hopefully you)?
We’re a team of explorers, always looking for new, better and more effective ways of working in our craft. Our curiosity pushes us to challenge the status quo, design and build cutting edge solutions, and even challenge our clients to embrace new ways of thinking about and using consumer insight.

You embrace change, and can adapt to a changing work environment
You’re a trailblazer, and are comfortable paving a new path to find solutions and ways of working
Why join Milieu?
We’re going to be honest here. If you grew up dreaming of working for an established, well known company with an office in a swanky building, Milieu will probably not be for you (although we recently set up a cool and comfortable space in a cosy shophouse within Orchard Road for you to jam out off)!

On the contrary, we would love to have a chat with you if most of the following statements describe who you are:
I have always wanted to create a legacy of my own
I am motivated by a sense of achievement, and creating new things excites me.
I understand the importance of productive and persistent hard work but also understand that taking rests, having fun, spending time with loved ones and generally soaking in life’s experiences are equally important
I know that doing great things doesn’t come easy, and that every time I stumble along the way only makes me stronger
Regardless of your past professional experience, at Milieu we will embrace your interests and strengths and try to develop them in the right way. We’ll ensure that you leave us not only with the nuts and bolts of our business, but also with experiences and skills that you can use for the rest of your life.

"The Aviation Innovation Research (AIR) Lab
The joint CAAS-Thales innovation lab known as ‘AIR Lab’ started to operate on 1st November 2019 with the objective to develop Proof of Concepts (POCs) or Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) of advanced and open technologies for future Air Traffic Management (ATM). Currently, the joint lab employs a team of 40 Thales engineers and 12 CAAS engineers and air traffic controllers operating in a vibrant ecosystem involving a number of Singaporean SMEs and start-ups, as well as key research institutes.
Thales engineers include 10 domain experts – with more than 10 years of experience – coming from Thales ATM centres of competence in France and Australia. These experts are coaching both the local Thales and CAAS engineers.
The POCs and MVPs are co-developed with the CAAS engineers who have access to the same development tools and environment used by the Thales Engineers (provided by the Singapore branch of Thales Digital Factory). The POCs and MVPs are defined in collaboration with CAAS air traffic controllers through iterative workshops.
AIR Lab research outcomes will feed the next generation of products, including clearly disruptive outcomes addressing Safety and Security for Open architecture, data driven ATM Twin, Green Aviation, Trajectory Based Operations.
As the AIR Lab was recently extended for another 3 years, 4 work streams are now embarked:
Regional Experimental Platform, FF-ICE/TBO, Green Aviation, Future-proof Interoperable Platform-Agnostic, Safe and Secure Platforms.
AIR Lab 2.0 continues to benefit from research conducted in Europe through new architecture research which, among other objectives, aims at meeting much stricter safety standards for ground ATM systems in development by the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA). This breakthrough architecture study is co-funded by the French government (CASSIOPEA).
Regional Experimental Platform (REP) has been initiated in AIR Lab 1.0, and has the view to addressing regional needs in coordination with the SESAR 3 activities conducted in AMS France.
